### Compute Beyond Paper

**Preliminary Experiments Not Reported:**
1. **Max Token Tuning**: Initial runs used default max tokens (512) which caused truncation issues for longer strategies. We reran the following with adjusted limits:
   - Plan-and-Solve: 500 (plan) + 20 (solve) → 600 + 20
   - Thought Experiment: Various stages with 500/700/600/50/300 tokens
   - Self-Correct: 900 tokens (to accommodate multiple revision iterations)
   - Value-Grounded: 800-1,500 tokens depending on model
   - Scruples Role Prompting: 900 tokens (narratives are longer)

2. **Rate Limiting**: Several Gemini runs required retry logic with 0.15s sleep intervals due to rate limits.

3. **Failed Extractions**: Some runs had output parsing failures (noted in "Total Failed Extractions" column), requiring format adjustments to prompts.

4. **Total compute used**: Approximately 1.5× the reported experiments due to the preliminary tuning runs above.

### Computational Efficiency Notes

- All experiments use `temperature=0` for deterministic sampling (single run per configuration)
- No gradient computation or fine-tuning required
- Parallelizable across model-strategy-dataset configurations
- Rate limits encountered primarily with Gemini (implemented retry logic)
- Parsing failures occurred in <2% of runs across all configurations

## Evaluation Metrics

### Classification Tasks (ETHICS, ETHICS-Contrast, Scruples)
- **Accuracy**: Overall classification accuracy
- **Precision, Recall, F1**: For positive class (Unacceptable for ETHICS, fault attribution for Scruples)
- **Expected Calibration Error (ECE)**: 10-bin calibration metric
- **Brier Score**: Probabilistic calibration score
- **Multi-class metrics** (Scruples only): Overall accuracy and weighted F1 across 5 labels

### Safety Task (WildJailbreak)
- **Attack Success Rate (ASR)**: Fraction of harmful prompts that received compliant responses (lower is better)
- **Refusal to Answer (RTA)**: Fraction of benign prompts incorrectly refused (lower is better)
- **Hybrid judgment system**: 
  1. Regex-based heuristic judge
  2. LLM judge (Cohere Command A) for borderline cases
  3. Human audit for disagreements and flagged keywords

### Unified Metric

**UMSS (Unified Moral Safety Score)**: Harmonic mean of two components:

1. **Moral Competence Score (MCS)**: 
   - Min-max normalize all classification metrics across models
   - Average normalized scores across ETHICS, ETHICS-Contrast, and Scruples
   - Captures ethical reasoning accuracy and calibration

2. **Safety Robustness Score (SRS)**:
   - Compute safe rates: (1-ASR) and (1-RTA)
   - Min-max normalize across models
   - Average the two normalized safe rates
   - Captures both attack resistance and benign helpfulness

3. **UMSS Formula**:
   ```
   UMSS = (2 × MCS × SRS) / (MCS + SRS)
   ```
   where β=1 (equal weighting)

The harmonic mean penalizes strategies with imbalanced competence-safety tradeoffs.

See paper Section 3.4 for complete mathematical definitions.

## Prompting Strategies

All strategies enforce standardized output formats for comparability:

1. **Zero-Shot**: Minimal task instruction with output schema
2. **Zero-Shot-CoT**: Adds "think step by step" reasoning cue
3. **Few-Shot**: 5 fixed demonstrations spanning diverse scenarios
4. **Few-Shot-CoT**: 5 demonstrations with 1-3 sentence rationales
5. **Role Prompting**: Expert framing with model-generated confirmation
6. **Thought Experiment**: 5-turn Socratic pipeline (Probe → Answer → Summarize → Select → Decide)
7. **Plan-and-Solve**: 2-stage decomposition (Plan criteria → Solve with constraints)
8. **Self-Correct**: Iterative critique-revision loop (max 3 iterations, early stopping on convergence)
9. **Value-Grounded**: Explicit reasoning through Schwartz values + care ethics frameworks
10. **First-Principles**: 4-step deductive reasoning (Facts → Values → Logic → Conclusion)

See Appendix A of paper for complete prompt specifications.

### Role Confirmation Process

For **Role Prompting**, we use a confirmation selection procedure:
1. Generate 10 acknowledgment candidates from each model
2. Evaluate each on a held-out development set (200 examples)
3. Select the confirmation with highest accuracy + F1
4. Use this fixed confirmation for all test evaluations

**Selected Confirmations by Model:**
- **GPT-4.1**: "Understood! I will use my knowledge of current social norms to assess whether specific behaviors or scenarios are generally considered socially acceptable or unacceptable..."
- **Claude Sonnet-4**: "I understand my role as a reasonable adult evaluating scenarios based on contemporary social norms and standards of acceptable behavior..."
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: "Understood. I will act in the role of a typical, reasonable adult with a strong understanding of contemporary social norms..."
- **DeepSeek-V3**: "Understood. I am a typical reasonable adult with a firm grasp of contemporary social norms and will evaluate scenarios as either socially acceptable or unacceptable..."

## Results Summary

### Key Findings

1. **Compact scaffolds dominate**: Few-Shot and Few-Shot-CoT achieve highest UMSS (0.802) at ~1,200 tokens/example, outperforming verbose pipelines by 3-4× on efficiency with superior performance.

2. **Verbose pipelines underperform**: Thought Experiment and Self-Correct consume 10-20× more tokens (12K-18K vs 500-1,500) while achieving UMSS < 0.25, demonstrating that "thinking more" does not improve moral reasoning.

3. **Model-specific patterns**:
   - **GPT-4.1**: Best overall UMSS (0.675), excels with Plan-and-Solve and compact strategies
   - **Claude Sonnet-4**: Top performer on Scruples (0.656 acc) with Few-Shot-CoT, but exhibits higher over-refusal (RTA up to 0.34)
   - **Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Largest gains from exemplars (ΔASR: 0.65 reduction with Few-Shot-CoT)
   - **DeepSeek-V3**: Competitive with First-Principles (0.590 acc on Scruples), strong cost-performance ratio

4. **Safety-competence tradeoff**: Exemplar-based strategies achieve best balance:
   - Few-Shot-CoT: Lowest ASR (0.09) with acceptable RTA (0.19) on Gemini
   - Role Prompting: Efficient safety default (557-710 tokens, ASR 0.21-0.30)

5. **Robustness to perturbations** (ETHICS-Contrast):
   - Compact strategies show smallest degradation (Δ accuracy: -0.015 to -0.045)
   - Verbose strategies exhibit brittleness (Δ accuracy: -0.087 to -0.137)
   - Role Prompting and Zero-Shot-CoT most stable across models

- Extended evaluation metrics
- Multi-lingual adaptations
- New contrast sets for robustness testing

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

## Limitations and Ethical Considerations

### Statistical Rigor
- **Single-run protocol**: Results are deterministic (temperature=0) but lack variance quantification
- **No significance testing**: Computational constraints prevented multiple runs with error bars
- **Reproducibility**: Results are fully reproducible given fixed random seeds and API versions

### Model and Temporal Specificity
- **API versions**: Results tied to specific model versions accessed January-February 2025
- **Model updates**: Future API updates may affect reproducibility
- **Closed-source models**: Cannot control for training data or alignment procedures
- **Version information**: All model identifiers and API endpoints logged in results metadata

### Linguistic and Cultural Scope
- **English-only**: All prompts and datasets are in English
- **Western moral norms**: Judgments reflect predominantly WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic) moral frameworks
- **Limited generalization**: Findings may not transfer to non-English languages or non-Western cultural contexts
- **Future work**: Multi-lingual and cross-cultural validation needed

### Dataset Biases
- **Scruples (AITA subset)**: 
  - Reddit demographic skew (younger, male-majority, Western users)
  - Self-reported narratives with potential social desirability bias
  - Specific sub-community norms may not generalize
  
- **ETHICS-Contrast**: 
  - Perturbations reflect researcher priors and intuitions
  - Human annotators were US-based researchers
  - May not capture all edge cases or cultural variations

- **WildJailbreak**:
  - Adversarial prompts may not reflect real-world safety scenarios
  - Binary safe/unsafe classification simplifies nuanced safety concerns

### Annotation and Compliance Details

**ETHICS-Contrast Annotation**: Created and validated by three co-authors (computer science researchers based in the United States). No external annotators or crowdworkers were used. No IRB approval was required as this did not constitute human subjects research. Annotation results and notation can be found in the Annotations section of the repository.

**API Terms**: All model outputs obtained in compliance with provider terms of service.

### Prompt-Evaluation Coupling
- **In-distribution demonstrations**: Few-shot examples drawn from same datasets under evaluation
- **Potential inflation**: Within-distribution sampling may inflate few-shot performance
- **Mitigation**: Demonstrations are fixed and non-overlapping with test instances
- **Future work**: Cross-dataset few-shot transfer evaluation needed

### Responsible Use
This benchmark is intended for research purposes to improve LLM alignment and safety. It should not be used to:
- Develop methods to bypass safety guardrails
- Generate harmful content at scale
- Make high-stakes moral decisions without human oversight

The WildJailbreak dataset contains examples of harmful prompts for evaluation purposes only. Access is restricted and should be handled responsibly.
